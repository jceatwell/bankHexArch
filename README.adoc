Following a Tutorial on Hexagonal architecture using golang

== Creating Initial Application

== Steps
1. Start at the Domain (domain.customer) and create interface
2. Introduce the "CustomerRepository interface"
3. Introduce the Adaptor (Stub) "CustomerRepository"
4. Create the Service Port ("CustomerService interface") + Default implementation
5. Create a Customer Hndler with a Customer Service
6. Finally wire up application in app.go (Define Handler with service aand adaptor)

=== Testing

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8080/customers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/xml'

curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8080/customers' \
